= AmazonEKSDocs Git History Squish Procedure
:toc:

== Overview
This procedure outlines the steps to clear the history of the "mainline" branch while maintaining a backup. The backup branch will be named with the current date (e.g., `13JAN2025-mainline`).

== Prerequisites
* Ensure you have the latest version of the repository
* Have appropriate permissions to push to mainline
* Verify you can build and deploy to alpha environment

== How to: Squish

* Only one person needs to do the branch work
* Then everyone needs to reset mainline on their devices

=== Initial Setup Steps

[source,bash]
----
# Sync and checkout mainline:
git fetch origin
git checkout mainline
git pull origin mainline

# Create a backup branch:
git checkout -b 13JAN2025-mainline
git push origin 13JAN2025-mainline
----

=== History Clean-up Steps

[source,bash]
----
# Create new orphan branch:
git checkout --orphan new/mainline

# Stage and commit all files:
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: History squish for mainline branch"
----

Verify build functionality:
* Build the project locally

[source,bash]
----
# Push the new branch:
git push origin new/mainline
----

NOTE: If a branch with this name already exists, deprecate it first

Deploy to alpha environment. Verify all functionality works as expected.

=== Production Switch

. After alpha verification, deprecate mainline on code.amazon.com

[source,bash]
----
# Clean up local branches:
git branch -D mainline
git checkout new/mainline

# Rename and establish new mainline:
git checkout -b mainline
git push origin mainline
----

=== Troubleshooting
* If you encounter push errors, ensure you've properly deprecated the old branches
* If build fails, verify all files were properly carried over in the orphan branch
* For any issues, consult with the team lead before proceeding

=== Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the backup branch (`13JAN2025-mainline`) can be used to restore the previous state.

== How to: update local copy

All team members must execute these steps to sync with the new mainline:

[source,bash]
----
# Switch to the new branch structure:
git checkout new/mainline

# Remove old mainline reference:
git branch -D mainline

# Update and switch to new mainline:
git fetch
git checkout mainline
----

== How to: Deprecate branch of code.amazon.com

. Open package on code.amazon.com
. In Repo info tab, scroll down to "Deprecate branch" dropdown menu
. Select the name of the branch and choose deprecate

NOTE: The branch is just archived and hidden, and it can be restored.

== How to: Add github remote

Ensure your SSH is configured with GitHub

[source,bash]
----
git remote add github git@github.com:awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide.git
----


== How to: Merge in GitHub changes

[source,bash]
----
git fetch github/mainline
----

== How to: Publish changes to github

[source,bash]
----
git push github
----
