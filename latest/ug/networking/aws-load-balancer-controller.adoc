Learn how to configure and use the {aws} Load Balancer Controller to expose Kubernetes cluster apps to the internet with {aws} Elastic Load Balancing for Kubernetes services and ingresses.
--

The {aws} Load Balancer Controller manages {aws} Elastic Load Balancers for a Kubernetes cluster. You can use the controller to expose your cluster apps to the internet. The controller provisions {aws} load balancers that point to cluster Service or Ingress resources. In other words, the controller creates a single IP address or DNS name that points to multiple pods in your cluster.

The controller watches for Kubernetes Ingress or Service resources. In response, it creates the appropriate {aws} Elastic Load Balancing resources. You can configure the specific behavior of the load balancers by applying annotations to the Kubernetes resources. For example, you can attach {aws} security groups to load balancers using annotations.  

The controller provisions the following resources: 

*Kubernetes `Ingress`*::
The LBC creates an link:elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[{aws} Application Load Balancer (ALB),type="documentation"] when you create a Kubernetes `Ingress`. https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/ingress/annotations/[Review the annotations you can apply to an Ingress resource.]


*Kubernetes service of the `LoadBalancer` type*::
The LBC creates an link:elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html[{aws} Network Load Balancer (NLB),type="documentation"]when you create a Kubernetes service of type `LoadBalancer`. https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/service/annotations/[Review the annotations you can apply to a Service resource.]
+
In the past, the Kubernetes network load balancer was used for _instance_ targets, but the LBC was used for _IP_ targets. With the {aws} Load Balancer Controller version `2.3.0` or later, you can create NLBs using either target type. For more information about NLB target types, see link:elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html#target-type[Target type,type="documentation"] in the User Guide for Network Load Balancers.

The controller is an https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller[open-source project] managed on GitHub.

Before deploying the controller, we recommend that you review the prerequisites and considerations in <<alb-ingress,Route application and HTTP traffic with Application Load Balancers>> and <<network-load-balancing>>. In those topics, you will deploy a sample app that includes an {aws} load balancer. 


[#lbc-overview]
== Install the controller

You can use one of the following procedures to install the {aws} Load Balancer Controller:



* If you are new to Amazon EKS we recommend that you use Helm for the installation because it simplifies the {aws} Load Balancer Controller installation. For more information, see <<lbc-helm>>. 
* For advanced configurations, such as clusters with restricted network access to public container registries,  use Kubernetes Manifests. For more information, see <<lbc-manifest>>.


[#lbc-deprecated]
== Migrate from deprecated controller versions

* If you have deprecated versions of the {aws} Load Balancer Controller installed, see <<lbc-remove>>.
* Deprecated versions cannot be upgraded. They must be removed and a current version of the {aws} Load Balancer Controller installed.  
+
[[lbc-deprecated-list]]
* Deprecated versions include:
+
** {aws} ALB Ingress Controller for Kubernetes ("Ingress Controller"), a predecessor to the {aws} Load Balancer Controller.
** Any `0.1.[.replaceable]``x``` version of the {aws} Load Balancer Controller


[#lbc-legacy]
== Legacy cloud provider

Kubernetes includes a legacy cloud provider for {aws}. The legacy cloud provider is capable of provisioning {aws} load balancers, similar to the {aws} Load Balancer Controller. The legacy cloud provider creates Classic Load Balancers. If you do not install the {aws} Load Balancer Controller, Kubernetes will default to using the legacy cloud provider. You should install the {aws} Load Balancer Controller and avoid using the legacy cloud provider.  

[IMPORTANT]
====

In versions 2.5 and newer, the {aws} Load Balancer Controller becomes the default controller for Kubernetes _service_ resources with the `type: LoadBalancer` and makes an {aws} Network Load Balancer (NLB) for each service. It does this by making a mutating webhook for services, which sets the `spec.loadBalancerClass` field to `service.k8s.aws/nlb` for new services of `type: LoadBalancer`. You can turn off this feature and revert to using the https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/service/annotations/#legacy-cloud-provider[legacy Cloud Provider] as the default controller, by setting the helm chart value `enableServiceMutatorWebhook` to `false`. The cluster won't provision new Classic Load Balancers for your services unless you turn off this feature. Existing Classic Load Balancers will continue to work.
