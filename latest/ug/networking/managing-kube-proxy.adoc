[#managing-kube-proxy]
= Manage `kube-proxy` in Amazon EKS clusters
:info_titleabbrev: kube-proxy

[abstract]
--
Learn how to manage the `kube-proxy` add-on on your Amazon EKS cluster to manage network rules and enable network communication to your Pods.
--

[TIP]
====
With Amazon EKS Auto Mode, you don't need to install or upgrade networking add-ons. Auto Mode includes pod networking and load balancing capabilities. 

For more information, see <<automode>>.

//GDC: Need DF to review


We recommend adding the Amazon EKS type of the add-on to your cluster instead of using the self-managed type of the add-on. If you're not familiar with the difference between the types, see <<eks-add-ons>>. For more information about adding an Amazon EKS add-on to your cluster, see <<creating-an-add-on>>. If you're unable to use the Amazon EKS add-on, we encourage you to submit an issue about why you can't to the https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues[Containers roadmap GitHub repository].

The `kube-proxy` add-on is deployed on each Amazon EC2 node in your Amazon EKS cluster. It maintains network rules on your nodes and enables network communication to your Pods. The add-on isn't deployed to Fargate nodes in your cluster. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/[kube-proxy] in the Kubernetes documentation.

[#kube-proxy-versions]
== `kube-proxy` versions

The following table lists the latest version of the Amazon EKS add-on type for each Kubernetes version.

|===
| Kubernetes version | `kube-proxy` version

| 1.33 | v1.33.0-eksbuild.2
| 1.32 | v1.32.6-eksbuild.2
| 1.31 | v1.31.10-eksbuild.2
| 1.30 | v1.30.14-eksbuild.2

[NOTE]
====

An earlier version of the documentation was incorrect. `kube-proxy` versions `v1.28.5`, `v1.27.9`, and `v1.26.12` aren't available.

If you're self-managing this add-on, the versions in the table might not be the same as the available self-managed versions.

[#managing-kube-proxy-images]
== `kube-proxy` container image

The `kube-proxy` container image is based on a https://gallery.ecr.aws/eks-distro-build-tooling/eks-distro-minimal-base-iptables[minimal base image] maintained by Amazon EKS Distro, which contains minimal packages and doesn't have shells. For more information, see https://distro.eks.amazonaws.com/[Amazon EKS Distro].

The following table lists the latest available self-managed `kube-proxy` container image version for each Amazon EKS cluster version.

When you <<updating-an-add-on,update an Amazon EKS add-on type>>, you specify a valid Amazon EKS add-on version, which might not be a version listed in this table. This is because <<add-ons-kube-proxy,Amazon EKS add-on>> versions don't always match container image versions specified when updating the self-managed type of this add-on. When you update the self-managed type of this add-on, you specify a valid container image version listed in this table.
