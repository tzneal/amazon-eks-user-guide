= Assign IPs to Pods with the Amazon VPC CNI
:info_titleabbrev: Amazon VPC CNI

[abstract]
--
Discover how the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes add-on works to assign private IP addresses and create network interfaces for Pods and services in your Amazon EKS cluster.
--

[TIP]
====
With Amazon EKS Auto Mode, you don't need to install or upgrade networking add-ons. Auto Mode includes pod networking and load balancing capabilities. 

For more information, see <<automode>>.
====

The Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes add-on is deployed on each Amazon EC2 node in your Amazon EKS cluster. The add-on creates link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html[elastic network interfaces,type="documentation"] and attaches them to your Amazon EC2 nodes. The add-on also assigns a private `IPv4` or `IPv6` address from your VPC to each Pod.

A version of the add-on is deployed with each Fargate node in your cluster, but you don't update it on Fargate nodes. Other compatible CNI plugins are available for use on Amazon EKS clusters, but this is the only CNI plugin supported by Amazon EKS for nodes that run on {aws} infrastructure. For more information about the other compatible CNI plugins, see <<alternate-cni-plugins>>. The VPC CNI isn't supported for use with hybrid nodes. For more information about your CNI options for hybrid nodes, see <<hybrid-nodes-cni>>.

The following table lists the latest available version of the Amazon EKS add-on type for each Kubernetes version.

[#vpc-cni-latest-available-version]

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you're self-managing this add-on, the versions in the table might not be the same as the available self-managed versions. For more information about updating the self-managed type of this add-on, see <<vpc-add-on-self-managed-update>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====

To upgrade to VPC CNI v1.12.0 or later, you must upgrade to VPC CNI v1.7.0 first. We recommend that you update one minor version at a time.

== Considerations

The following are considerations for using the feature.

* Versions are specified as `major-version.minor-version.patch-version-eksbuild.build-number`.
* Check version compatibility for each feature. Some features of each release of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes require certain Kubernetes versions. When using different Amazon EKS features, if a specific version of the add-on is required, then it's noted in the feature documentation. Unless you have a specific reason for running an earlier version, we recommend running the latest version.
