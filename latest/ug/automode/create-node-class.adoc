= Create a Node Class for Amazon EKS
:info_titleabbrev: Create node class

Amazon EKS Node Classes are templates that offer granular control over the configuration of your EKS Auto Mode managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration, storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements.

When you need to customize how EKS Auto Mode provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings, creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters. For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom tagging for cost allocation.

== Create a Node Class

To create a `NodeClass`, follow these steps:

. Create a YAML file (for example, `nodeclass.yaml`) with your Node Class configuration
. Apply the configuration to your cluster using `kubectl`
. Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see <<create-node-pool>>.

You need `kubectl` installed and configured. For more information, see <<setting-up>>.

=== Basic Node Class Example

Here's an example Node Class:

//GDC: need to update this with IAM role and subnet selector

```yaml
apiVersion: eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: NodeClass
metadata:
  name: private-compute
spec:
  subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "private-subnet"
        kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: "1"
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "eks-cluster-sg"
  ephemeralStorage:
    size: "160Gi" 
```

This NodeClass increases the amount of ephemeral storage on the node. 

Apply this configuration by using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nodeclass.yaml
```

Next, reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see <<create-node-pool>>.

[#auto-node-access-entry]
== Create node class access entry

If you create a custom node class, you need to create an EKS Access Entry to permit the nodes to join the cluster. EKS automatically creates access entries when you use the built-in node class and node pools. 

For information about how Access Entries work, see <<access-entries>>.

When creating access entries for EKS Auto Mode node classes, you need to use the `EC2` access entry type. 

=== Create access entry with CLI

*To create an access entry for EC2 nodes and associate the EKS Auto Node Policy:*

Update the following CLI commands with your cluster name, and node role ARN. The node role ARN is specified in the node class YAML. 

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
# Create the access entry for EC2 nodes
aws eks create-access-entry \
  --cluster-name <cluster-name> \
  --principal-arn <node-role-arn> \
  --type EC2

# Associate the auto node policy
aws eks associate-access-policy \
  --cluster-name <cluster-name> \
  --principal-arn <node-role-arn> \
  --policy-arn {arn-aws}eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSAutoNodePolicy \
  --access-scope type=cluster
----

=== Create access entry with CloudFormation

*To create an access entry for EC2 nodes and associate the EKS Auto Node Policy:*

Update the following CloudFormation with your cluster name, and node role ARN. The node role ARN is specified in the node class YAML. 

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
EKSAutoNodeRoleAccessEntry:
  Type: AWS::EKS::AccessEntry
  Properties:
    ClusterName: <cluster-name>
    PrincipalArn: <node-role-arn>
    Type: "EC2"
    AccessPolicies:
      - AccessScope:
          Type: cluster
        PolicyArn: {arn-aws}eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSAutoNodePolicy
  DependsOn: [ <cluster-name> ] # previously defined in CloudFormation
----

== Considerations

* If you want to verify how much local storage an instance has, you can describe the node to see the ephemeral storage resource.
* *Volume Encryption* - EKS uses the configured custom KMS key to encrypt the read-only root volume of the instance and the read/write data volume. 
* *Replace the node IAM role* - If you change the node IAM role associated with a `NodeClass`, you will need to create a new Access Entry. EKS automatically creates an Access Entry for the node IAM role during cluster creation. The node IAM role requires the `AmazonEKSAutoNodePolicy` EKS Access Policy. For more information, see <<access-entries>>.
* *maximum pod density* - EKS limits the maximum number of pods on a node to 110. This limit is applied after the existing max pods calculation. For more information, see <<choosing-instance-type>>.
* *Tags* - If you want to propagate tags from Kubernetes to EC2, you need to configure additional IAM permissions. For more information, see <<auto-learn-iam>>.
* *Default node class* - Do not name your custom node class `default`. This is because EKS Auto Mode includes a `NodeClass` called `default` that is automatically provisioned when you enable at least one built-in `NodePool`. For information about enabling built-in `NodePools`, see <<set-builtin-node-pools>>.
* *`subnetSelectorTerms` behavior with multiple subnets* - If there are multiple subnets that match the `subnetSelectorTerms` conditions or that you provide by ID, EKS Auto Mode creates nodes distributed across the subnets.

** If the subnets are in different Availability Zones (AZ), you can use Kubernetes features like https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#pod-topology-spread-constraints[Pod topology spread constraints ] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/topology-aware-routing/[Topology Aware Routing] to spread pods and traffic across the zones, respectively.

** If there are multiple subnets __in the same AZ__ that match the `subnetSelectorTerms`, EKS Auto Mode creates pods on each node distributed across the subnets in that AZ. EKS Auto Mode creates secondary network interfaces on each node in the other subnets in the same AZ. It chooses based on the number of available IP addresses in each subnet, to use the subnets more efficiently. However, you can't specify which subnet EKS Auto Mode uses for each pod; if you need pods to run in specific subnets, use <<pod-subnet-selector>> instead.


[#pod-subnet-selector]
== Subnet selection for Pods

The `podSubnetSelectorTerms` and `podSecurityGroupSelectorTerms` fields enables advanced networking configurations by allowing pods to run in different subnets than their nodes. This separation provides enhanced control over network traffic routing and security policies. Note that `podSecurityGroupSelectorTerms` are required with the `podSubnetSelectorTerms`.

=== Use cases

Use `podSubnetSelectorTerms` when you need to:

* Separate infrastructure traffic (node-to-node communication) from application traffic (pod-to-pod communication)
* Apply different network configurations to node subnets than pod subnets.
* Implement different security policies or routing rules for nodes and pods.
* Configure reverse proxies or network filtering specifically for node traffic without affecting pod traffic. Use `advancedNetworking` and `certificateBundles` to define your reverse proxy and any self-signed or private certificates for the proxy.

=== Example configuration

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: NodeClass
metadata:
  name: advanced-networking
spec:
  role: MyNodeRole
  
  # Subnets for EC2 instances (nodes)
  subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "node-subnet"
        kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: "1"
  
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "eks-cluster-sg"
  
  # Separate subnets for pods
  podSubnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "pod-subnet"
        kubernetes.io/role/pod: "1"
  
  podSecurityGroupSelectorTerms:
  - tags:
      Name: "eks-pod-sg"
----

=== Considerations for subnet selectors for pods

* *Reduced pod density*: Fewer pods can run on each node when using `podSubnetSelectorTerms`, because the primary network interface of the node is in the node subnet, and can't be used for pods in the pod subnet.
* *Subnet selector limitations*: The standard `subnetSelectorTerms` and `securityGroupSelectorTerms` configurations don't apply to pod subnet selection.
* *Network planning*: Ensure adequate IP address space in both node and pod subnets to support your workload requirements.
* *Routing configuration*: Verify that route table and network Access Control List (ACL) of the pod subnets are properly configured for communication between node and pod subnets.
