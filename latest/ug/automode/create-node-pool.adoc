= Create a Node Pool for EKS Auto Mode
:info_titleabbrev: Create node pool

include::../attributes.txt[]

Amazon EKS node pools provide a flexible way to manage compute resources in your Kubernetes cluster. This topic demonstrates how to create and configure node pools using Karpenter, a node provisioning tool that helps optimize cluster scaling and resource utilization. With Karpenter's NodePool resource, you can define specific requirements for your compute resources, including instance types, availability zones, architectures, and capacity types.

You cannot modify the built in `system` and `general-purpose` node pools. You can only enable or disable them. For more information, see <<set-builtin-node-pools>>.

The NodePool specification allows for fine-grained control over your EKS cluster's compute resources through various supported labels and requirements. These include options for specifying EC2 instance categories, CPU configurations, availability zones, architectures (ARM64/AMD64), and capacity types (spot/on-demand). You can also set resource limits for CPU and memory usage, ensuring your cluster stays within desired operational boundaries. 

EKS Auto Mode leverages well-known Kubernetes labels to provide consistent and standardized ways of identifying node characteristics. These labels, such as `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` for availability zones and `kubernetes.io/arch` for CPU architecture, follow established Kubernetes conventions. Additionally, EKS-specific labels (prefixed with `eks.amazonaws.com/`) extend this functionality with {aws}-specific attributes like instance types, CPU manufacturers, GPU capabilities, and networking specifications. This standardized labeling system enables seamless integration with existing Kubernetes tooling while providing deep {aws} infrastructure integration.

## Create a NodePool

Follow these steps to create a NodePool for your Amazon EKS cluster:

. Create a YAML file named `nodepool.yaml` with your desired NodePool configuration. You can use the sample configuration below. 
. Apply the NodePool to your cluster:
+
```bash
kubectl apply -f nodepool.yaml
```
. Verify that the NodePool was created successfully:
+
```bash
kubectl get nodepools
```
. (Optional) Monitor the NodePool status:
+
```bash
kubectl describe nodepool default
```

Ensure that your NodePool references a valid NodeClass that exists in your cluster. The NodeClass defines {aws}-specific configurations for your compute resources. For more information, see <<create-node-class>>.

NOTE: EKS Auto Mode only supports certain instances, and has minimum size requirements. For more information, see <<auto-supported-instances>>.

== EKS Auto Mode Not Supported Labels

EKS Auto Mode does not support the following labels. 

* EKS Auto Mode only supports Linux
** `node.kubernetes.io/windows-build`
** `kubernetes.io/os`

== Disable built-in node pools

If you create custom node pools, you can disable the built-in node pools. For more information, see <<set-builtin-node-pools>>.

== Cluster without built-in node pools

You can create a cluster without the built-in node pools. This is helpful when your organization has created customized node pools. 

*Overview:*

. Create an EKS cluster with the both `nodePools` and `nodeRoleArn` values empty.
** Sample eksctl `autoModeConfig`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
autoModeConfig:
  enabled: true
  nodePools: []
  # Do not set a nodeRoleARN
----
+
For more information, see <<automode-get-started-eksctl>>
. Create a custom node class with a node role ARN
** For more information, see <<create-node-class>>
. Create an access entry for the custom node class
** For more information, see <<auto-node-access-entry>>
. Create a custom node pool, as described above.

== Disruption

You can configure EKS Auto Mode to disrupt Nodes through your NodePool in multiple ways. You can use `spec.disruption.consolidationPolicy`, `spec.disruption.consolidateAfter`, or `spec.template.spec.expireAfter`. You can also rate limit EKS Auto Mode's disruption through the NodePool’s `spec.disruption.budgets`. You can also control the time windows and number of simultaneous Nodes disrupted. For instructions on configuring this behavior, see https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/disruption/[Disruption] in the Karpenter Documentation. 

You can configure disruption for node pools to:

- Identify when instances are underutilized, and consolidate workloads.
- Create a node pool disruption budget to rate limit node terminations due to drift, emptiness, and consolidation. 

By default, EKS Auto Mode:

- Consolidates underutilized instances. 
- Terminates instances after 720 hours. 
- Sets a single disruption budget of 10% of nodes.
