:aam: Amazon {am}
:ec2i: EC2 Instance
:mi: managed instance
:info_titleabbrev: Managed instances

This topic explains how {aam} manages Amazon EC2 instances in your EKS cluster. When you enable {am}, your cluster's compute resources are automatically provisioned and managed by EKS, changing how you interact with the EC2 instances that serve as nodes in your cluster.

Understanding how {aam} manages instances is essential for planning your workload deployment strategy and operational procedures. Unlike traditional EC2 instances or managed node groups, these instances follow a different lifecycle model where EKS assumes responsibility for many operational aspects, while restricting certain types of access and customization.

{aam} automates routine tasks for creating new {ec2i}s, and attaches them as nodes to your EKS cluster. {am} detects when a workload can't fit onto existing nodes, and creates a new {ec2i}. 

{aam} is responsible for creating, deleting, and patching {ec2i}s. You are responsible for the containers and pods deployed on the instance. 

{ec2i}s created by {am} are different from other {ec2i}s, they are {mi}s. These {mi}s are owned by EKS and are more restricted. You can't directly access or install software on instances managed by {am}. 

{aws} suggests running either EKS Auto Mode or self-managed Karpenter. You can install both during a migration or in an advanced configuration. If you have both installed, configure your node pools so that workloads are associated with either Karpenter or EKS Auto Mode.

|You are responsible for patching and updating the instance.
|{aws} automatically patches and updates the instance.

|EKS is not responsible for the software on the instance.
|EKS is responsible for certain software on the instance, such as `kubelet`, the container runtime, and the operating system. 

|You can delete the {ec2i} using the EC2 API. 
|EKS determines the number of instances deployed in your account. If you delete a workload, EKS will reduce the number of instances in your account. 

|You can use SSH to access the {ec2i}. 
|You can deploy pods and containers to the {mi}. 

|You determine the operating system and image (AMI).
|{aws} determines the operating system and image. 

|You can deploy workloads that rely on Windows or Ubuntu functionality.  
|You can deploy containers based on Linux, but without specific OS dependencies. 

|You determine what instance type and family to launch.
|{aws} determines what instance type and family to launch. You can use a Node Pool to limit the instance types EKS Auto Mode selects from. 

|=== 


The following functionality works for both Managed instances and Standard EC2 instances: 

* You can view the instance in the {aws} console. 
* You can use instance storage as ephemeral storage for workloads. 

=== AMI Support

With EKS Auto Mode, {aws} determines the image (AMI) used for your compute nodes. {aws} monitors the rollout of new EKS Auto Mode AMI versions. If you experience workload issues related to an AMI version, create a support case. For more information, see link:awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html["Creating support cases and case management",type="documentation"] in the {aws} Support User Guide.

Generally, EKS releases a new AMI each week containing CVE and security fixes. 

[#auto-supported-instances]
== EKS Auto Mode supported instance reference

EKS Auto Mode only creates instances of supported types, and that meet a minimum size requirement. 

EKS Auto Mode supports the following instance types:

Additionally, EKS Auto Mode will only create EC2 instances that meet the following requirements:

* More than 1 CPU
* Instance size is not nano, micro or small

For more information, see link:ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-type-names.html["Amazon EC2 instance type naming conventions",type="documentation"].

== Instance Metadata Service

* EKS Auto Mode enforces IMDSv2 with a hop limit of 1 by default, adhering to {aws} security best practices.
* This default configuration cannot be modified in Auto Mode.
* For add-ons that typically require IMDS access, supply parameters (such as {aws} region) during installation to avoid IMDS lookups. For more information, see <<kubernetes-field-management>>.
* If a Pod absolutely requires IMDS access when running in Auto Mode, the Pod must be configured to run with `hostNetwork: true`. This allows the Pod to access the instance metadata service directly.
* Consider the security implications when granting Pods access to instance metadata.

For more information about the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), see link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html[Configure the Instance Metadata Service options,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.


== Considerations

* If the configured ephemeral storage in the NodeClass is smaller than the NVMe local storage for the instance, EKS Auto Mode eliminates the need for manual configuration by automatically taking the following actions:
** Uses a smaller (20 GiB) Amazon EBS data volume to reduce costs.
** Formats and configures the NVMe local storage for ephemeral data use. This includes setting up a RAID 0 array if there are multiple NVMe drives.
* Amazon EKS Auto Mode does not support {aws} Fault Injection Service. For more information, see link:resilience-hub/latest/userguide/testing.html["Managing Fault Injection Service experiments",type="documentation"] in the {aws} Resilience Hub User Guide. 
* You do not need to install the `Neuron Device Plugin` on EKS Auto Mode nodes.
+
If you have other types of nodes in your cluster, you need to configure the Neuron Device plugin to not run on Auto Mode nodes. For more information, see <<associate-workload>>.
