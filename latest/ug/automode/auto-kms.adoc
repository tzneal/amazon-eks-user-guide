= Enable EBS Volume Encryption with Customer Managed KMS Keys for EKS Auto Mode
:info_titleabbrev: Encrypt root volumes 

You can encrypt the ephemeral root volume for EKS Auto Mode instances with a customer managed KMS key. 

Amazon EKS Auto Mode uses service-linked roles to delegate permissions to other {aws} services when managing encrypted EBS volumes for your Kubernetes clusters. This topic describes how to set up the key policy that you need when specifying a customer managed key for Amazon EBS encryption with EKS Auto Mode.

Considerations:

* EKS Auto Mode does not need additional authorization to use the default {aws} managed key to protect the encrypted volumes in your account.
* This topic covers encrypting ephemeral volumes, the root volumes for EC2 instances. For more information about encrypting data volumes used for workloads, see <<create-storage-class>>. 

== Overview

The following {aws} KMS keys can be used for Amazon EBS root volume encryption when EKS Auto Mode launches instances:

* *{aws} managed key* – An encryption key in your account that Amazon EBS creates, owns, and manages. This is the default encryption key for a new account.

* *Customer managed key* – A custom encryption key that you create, own, and manage.

[NOTE]
====
The key must be symmetric. Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric customer managed keys.
====

== Step 1: Configure the key policy

Your KMS keys must have a key policy that allows EKS Auto Mode to launch instances with Amazon EBS volumes encrypted with a customer managed key.

Configure your key policy with the following structure:


[NOTE]
====
This policy only includes permissions for EKS Auto Mode. The key policy may need additional permissions if other identities need to use the key or manage grants.

----

Make sure to replace `<account-id>` with your actual {aws} account ID.

When configuring the key policy:

* The `ClusterServiceRole` must have the necessary IAM permissions to use the KMS key for encryption operations
* The `kms:GrantIsForAWSResource` condition ensures that grants can only be created for {aws} services

== Step 2: Configure NodeClass with your customer managed key

After configuring the key policy, reference the KMS key in your EKS Auto Mode NodeClass configuration:

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: NodeClass
metadata:
  name: my-node-class
spec:
  # Insert existing configuration

  ephemeralStorage:
    size: "80Gi"  # Range: 1-59000Gi or 1-64000G or 1-58Ti or 1-64T
    iops: 3000    # Range: 3000-16000
    throughput: 125  # Range: 125-1000

    # KMS key for encryption
    kmsKeyID: "{arn-aws}kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<key-id>"
----

Replace the placeholder values with your actual values:

* `<region>` with your {aws} region
* `<account-id>` with your {aws} account ID
* `<key-id>` with your KMS key ID

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following formats:

* KMS Key ID: `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d`
* KMS Key ARN: `{arn-aws}kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d`
* Key Alias Name: `alias/eks-auto-mode-key`
* Key Alias ARN: `{arn-aws}kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/eks-auto-mode-key`

Apply the NodeClass configuration using kubectl:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f nodeclass.yaml
----
