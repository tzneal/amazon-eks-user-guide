Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes platform that empowers organizations to deploy, manage, and scale AI and machine learning (ML) workloads with unparalleled flexibility and control. Built on the open source Kubernetes ecosystem, EKS lets you harness your existing Kubernetes expertise, while integrating seamlessly with open source tools and {aws} services.

Whether you’re training large-scale models, running real-time online inference, or deploying generative AI applications, EKS delivers the performance, scalability, and cost efficiency your AI/ML projects demand.


## Why Choose EKS for AI/ML?

EKS is a managed Kubernetes platform that helps you deploy and manage complex AI/ML workloads.
Built on the open source Kubernetes ecosystem, it integrates with {aws} services, providing the control and scalability needed for advanced projects.
For teams new to AI/ML deployments, existing Kubernetes skills transfer directly, allowing efficient orchestration of multiple workloads.

EKS supports everything from operating system customizations to compute scaling, and its open source foundation promotes technological flexibility, preserving freedom of choice for future infrastructure decisions.
The platform provides the performance and tuning options AI/ML workloads require, supporting features such as:

* Full cluster control to fine-tune costs and configurations without hidden abstractions
* Sub-second latency for real-time inference workloads in production
* Advanced customizations like multi-instance GPUs, multi-cloud strategies, and OS-level tuning
* Ability to centralize workloads using EKS as a unified orchestrator across AI/ML pipelines

## Key use cases

Amazon EKS provides a robust platform for a wide range of AI/ML workloads, supporting various technologies and deployment patterns:

* **Real-time (online) inference:** EKS powers immediate predictions on incoming data, such as fraud detection, with sub-second latency using tools like https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-torchserve.html[TorchServe],
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/quora-3x-faster-machine-learning-25-lower-costs-with-nvidia-triton-on-amazon-eks/[Triton Inference Server], and https://kserve.github.io/website/0.8/get_started/first_isvc/[KServe] on Amazon EC2 https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/[Inf1]
and https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/[Inf2] instances.
These workloads benefit from dynamic scaling with https://karpenter.sh/[Karpenter] and https://keda.sh/[KEDA], while leveraging https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[Amazon EFS] for model sharding across pods.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache-creating-rule.html[Amazon ECR Pull Through Cache (PTC)] accelerates model updates,
and https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/[Bottlerocket] data volumes with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/what-is-ebs.html[Amazon EBS]-optimized volumes ensure fast data access.

* **General model training:** Organizations leverage EKS to train complex models on large datasets over extended periods using the https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/trainer/[Kubeflow Training Operator (KRO)],
https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html[Ray Serve], and https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.elastic.html[Torch Distributed Elastic] on https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/[Amazon EC2 P4d] and https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/[Amazon EC2 Trn1] instances.
These workloads are supported by batch scheduling with tools like https://volcano.sh/en/#home_slider[Volcano],
https://yunikorn.apache.org/[Yunikorn],
and https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/[Kueue].
https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[Amazon EFS] enables sharing of model checkpoints, and https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3] handles model import/export with lifecycle policies for version management.

* **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines:** EKS manages customer support chatbots and similar applications by integrating retrieval and generation processes. These workloads often use tools like https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/[Argo Workflows] and https://www.kubeflow.org/[Kubeflow] for orchestration, vector databases like https://www.pinecone.io/blog/serverless/[Pinecone], https://weaviate.io/[Weaviate], or https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/[Amazon OpenSearch], and expose applications to users via the 
<<aws-load-balancer-controller,Application Load Balancer Controller (LBC)>>. https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/index.html[NVIDIA NIM] optimizes GPU utilization, while <<prometheus,Prometheus>> and https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/[Grafana] monitor resource usage.

* **Generative AI model deployment:** Companies deploy real-time content creation services on EKS, such as text or image generation, using https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html[Ray Serve], https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm[vLLM], and https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/quora-3x-faster-machine-learning-25-lower-costs-with-nvidia-triton-on-amazon-eks/[Triton Inference Server] on Amazon https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/[EC2 G5] and https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/[Inferentia] accelerators. These deployments optimize performance and memory utilization for large-scale models. https://jupyter.org/hub[JupyterHub] enables iterative development, https://www.gradio.app/[Gradio] provides simple web interfaces, and the <<s3-csi,S3 Mountpoint CSI Driver>> allows mounting S3 buckets as file systems for accessing large model files.

* **Batch (offline) inference:** Organizations process large datasets efficiently through scheduled jobs with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/what-is-batch.html[{aws} Batch] or https://volcano.sh/en/docs/schduler_introduction/[Volcano]. These workloads often use https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/[Inf1] and https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/[Inf2] EC2 instances for {aws} https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/[Inferentia] chips, Amazon EC2 https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/[G4dn] instances for NVIDIA T4 GPUs, or https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/[c5] and https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6i[c6i] CPU instances, maximizing resource utilization during off-peak hours for analytics tasks. The https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/neuron/[{aws} Neuron SDK] and NVIDIA GPU drivers optimize performance, while MIG/TS enables GPU sharing. Storage solutions include https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3] and Amazon https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[EFS] and https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/[FSx for Lustre], with CSI drivers for various storage classes. Model management leverages tools like https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/[Kubeflow Pipelines], https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/[Argo Workflows], and https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html[Ray Cluster], while monitoring is handled by <<prometheus,Prometheus>>, https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/[Grafana] and custom model monitoring tools.
