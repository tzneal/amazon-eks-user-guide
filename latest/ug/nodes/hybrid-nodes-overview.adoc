[abstract]
--
Join nodes from your data centers to Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes.
--

With _Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes_, you can use your on-premises and edge infrastructure as nodes in Amazon EKS clusters. {aws} manages the {aws}-hosted Kubernetes control plane of the Amazon EKS cluster, and you manage the hybrid nodes that run in your on-premises or edge environments. This unifies Kubernetes management across your environments and offloads Kubernetes control plane management to {aws} for your on-premises and edge applications.

Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes works with any on-premises hardware or virtual machines, bringing the efficiency, scalability, and availability of Amazon EKS to wherever your applications need to run. You can use a wide range of Amazon EKS features with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes including Amazon EKS add-ons, Amazon EKS Pod Identity, cluster access entries, cluster insights, and extended Kubernetes version support. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes natively integrates with {aws} services including {aws} Systems Manager, {aws} IAM Roles Anywhere, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, and Amazon CloudWatch for centralized monitoring, logging, and identity management.

With Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes, there are no upfront commitments or minimum fees, and you are charged per hour for the vCPU resources of your hybrid nodes when they are attached to your Amazon EKS clusters. For more pricing information, see link:eks/pricing/[Amazon EKS Pricing,type="marketing"].

[#hybrid-nodes-features]
== Features

EKS Hybrid Nodes has the following high-level features:

* *Managed Kubernetes control plane*: {aws} manages the {aws}-hosted Kubernetes control plane of the EKS cluster, and you manage the hybrid nodes that run in your on-premises or edge environments. This unifies Kubernetes management across your environments and offloads Kubernetes control plane management to {aws} for your on-premises and edge applications. By moving the Kubernetes control plane to {aws}, you can conserve on-premises capacity for your applications and trust that the Kubernetes control plane scales with your workloads.
* *Consistent EKS experience*: Most EKS features are supported with EKS Hybrid Nodes for a consistent EKS experience across your on-premises and cloud environments including EKS add-ons, EKS Pod Identity, cluster access entries, cluster insights, extended Kubernetes version support, and more. See <<hybrid-nodes-add-ons>> for more information on the EKS add-ons supported with EKS Hybrid Nodes.
* *Centralized observability and identity management*: EKS Hybrid Nodes natively integrates with {aws} services including {aws} Systems Manager, {aws} IAM Roles Anywhere, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, and Amazon CloudWatch for centralized monitoring, logging, and identity management.
* *Burst-to-cloud or add on-premises capacity*: A single EKS cluster can be used to run hybrid nodes and nodes in {aws} Regions, {aws} Local Zones, or {aws} Outposts to burst-to-cloud or add on-premises capacity to your EKS clusters. See <<hybrid-nodes-considerations-mixed-mode, Considerations for mixed mode clusters>> for more information.
* *Flexible infrastructure*: EKS Hybrid Nodes follows a _bring your own infrastructure_ approach and is agnostic to the infrastructure you use for hybrid nodes. You can run hybrid nodes on physical or virtual machines, and x86 and ARM architectures, making it possible to migrate on-premises workloads running on hybrid nodes across different infrastructure types.
* *Flexible networking*: With EKS Hybrid Nodes, communication between the EKS control plane and hybrid nodes is routed through the VPC and subnets you pass during cluster creation, which builds on the link:eks/latest/best-practices/subnets.html[existing mechanism,type="documentation"] in EKS for control plane to node networking. This is flexible to your preferred method of connecting your on-premises networks to a VPC in {aws}. There are several link:whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/network-to-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.html[documented options,type="documentation"] available including {aws} Site-to-Site VPN, {aws} Direct Connect, or your own VPN solution, and you can choose the method that best fits your use case.

[#hybrid-node-limits]
== Limits

* Up to 15 CIDRs for Remote Node Networks and 15 CIDRs for Remote Pod Networks per cluster are supported.

[#hybrid-nodes-general]
== Considerations

* EKS Hybrid Nodes can be used with new or existing EKS clusters.
* EKS Hybrid Nodes is available in all {aws} Regions, except the {aws} GovCloud (US) Regions and the {aws} China Regions.
* EKS Hybrid Nodes must have a reliable connection between your on-premises environment and {aws}. EKS Hybrid Nodes is not a fit for disconnected, disrupted, intermittent or limited (DDIL) environments. If you are running in a DDIL environment, consider link:eks/eks-anywhere/[Amazon EKS Anywhere,type="marketing"]. Reference the link:eks/latest/best-practices/hybrid-nodes-network-disconnections.html[Best Practices for EKS Hybrid Nodes,type="documentation"] for information on how hybrid nodes behave during network disconnection scenarios.
* Running EKS Hybrid Nodes on cloud infrastructure, including {aws} Regions, {aws} Local Zones, {aws} Outposts, or in other clouds, is not supported. You will be charged the hybrid nodes fee if you run hybrid nodes on Amazon EC2 instances.
* Billing for hybrid nodes starts when the nodes join the EKS cluster and stops when the nodes are removed from the cluster. Be sure to remove your hybrid nodes from your EKS cluster if you are not using them.
