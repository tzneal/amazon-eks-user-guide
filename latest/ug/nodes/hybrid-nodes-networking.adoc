[#hybrid-nodes-networking-on-prem]
== On-premises networking configuration

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-min-reqs]
=== Minimum network requirements

For an optimal experience, we recommend that you have reliable network connectivity of at least 100 Mbps and a maximum of 200ms round trip latency for the hybrid nodes connection to the {aws} Region. This is general guidance that accommodates most use cases but is not a strict requirement. The bandwidth and latency requirements can vary depending on the number of hybrid nodes and your workload characteristics, such as application image size, application elasticity, monitoring and logging configurations, and application dependencies on accessing data stored in other {aws} services. We recommend that you test with your own applications and environments before deploying to production to validate that your networking setup meets the requirements for your workloads.

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-on-prem-cidrs]
=== On-premises node and pod CIDRs

Identify the node and pod CIDRs you will use for your hybrid nodes and the workloads running on them. The node CIDR is allocated from your on-premises network and the pod CIDR is allocated from your Container Network Interface (CNI) if you are using an overlay network for your CNI. You pass your on-premises node CIDRs and pod CIDRs as inputs when you create your EKS cluster with the `RemoteNodeNetwork` and `RemotePodNetwork` fields. Your on-premises node CIDRs must be routable on your on-premises network. See the following section for information on the on-premises pod CIDR routability.

The on-premises node and pod CIDR blocks must meet the following requirements:

1. Be within one of the following `IPv4` RFC-1918 ranges: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, or `192.168.0.0/16`.
2. Not overlap with each other, the VPC CIDR for your EKS cluster, or your Kubernetes service `IPv4` CIDR.

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-on-prem-pod-routing]
=== On-premises pod network routing

When using EKS Hybrid Nodes, we generally recommend that you make your on-premises pod CIDRs routable on your on-premises network to enable full cluster communication and functionality between cloud and on-premises environments.

*Routable pod networks*

If you are able to make your pod network routable on your on-premises network, follow the guidance below.

1. Configure the `RemotePodNetwork` field for your EKS cluster with your on-premises pod CIDR, your VPC route tables with your on-premises pod CIDR, and your EKS cluster security group with your on-premises pod CIDR.
2. There are several techniques you can use to make your on-premises pod CIDR routable on your on-premises network including Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), static routes, or other custom routing solutions. BGP is the recommended solution as it is more scalable and easier to manage than alternative solutions that require custom or manual route configuration. {aws} supports the BGP capabilities of Cilium and Calico for advertising pod CIDRs, see <<hybrid-nodes-cni>> and <<hybrid-nodes-concepts-k8s-pod-cidrs>> for more information.
3. Webhooks can run on hybrid nodes as the EKS control plane is able to communicate with the Pod IP addresses assigned to the webhooks. 
4. Workloads running on cloud nodes are able to communicate directly with workloads running on hybrid nodes in the same EKS cluster.
5. Other {aws} services, such as {aws} Application Load Balancers and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, are able to communicate with workloads running on hybrid nodes to balance network traffic and scrape pod metrics.

*Unroutable pod networks*

If you are _not_ able to make your pod networks routable on your on-premises network, follow the guidance below.

1. Webhooks cannot run on hybrid nodes because webhooks require connectivity from the EKS control plane to the Pod IP addresses assigned to the webhooks. In this case, we recommend that you run webhooks on cloud nodes in the same EKS cluster as your hybrid nodes, see <<hybrid-nodes-webhooks>> for more information.
2. Workloads running on cloud nodes are not able to communicate directly with workloads running on hybrid nodes when using the VPC CNI for cloud nodes and Cilium or Calico for hybrid nodes. 
3. Use Service Traffic Distribution to keep traffic local to the zone it is originating from. For more information on Service Traffic Distribution, see <<hybrid-nodes-mixed-service-traffic-distribution>>.
4. Configure your CNI to use egress masquerade or network address translation (NAT) for pod traffic as it leaves your on-premises hosts. This is enabled by default in Cilium. Calico requires `natOutgoing` to be set to `true`.
5. Other {aws} services, such as {aws} Application Load Balancers and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, are not able to communicate with workloads running on hybrid nodes.

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-access-reqs]
=== Access required during hybrid node installation and upgrade

You must have access to the following domains during the installation process where you install the hybrid nodes dependencies on your hosts. This process can be done once when you are building your operating system images or it can be done on each host at runtime. This includes initial installation and when you upgrade the Kubernetes version of your hybrid nodes.

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-eks-network-interfaces]
=== Amazon EKS network interfaces

Amazon EKS attaches network interfaces to the subnets in the VPC you pass during cluster creation to enable the communication between the EKS control plane and your VPC. The network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates can be found after cluster creation in the Amazon EC2 console or with the {aws} CLI. The original network interfaces are deleted and new network interfaces are created when changes are applied on your EKS cluster, such as Kubernetes version upgrades. You can restrict the IP range for the Amazon EKS network interfaces by using constrained subnet sizes for the subnets you pass during cluster creation, which makes it easier to configure your on-premises firewall to allow inbound/outbound connectivity to this known, constrained set of IPs. To control which subnets network interfaces are created in, you can limit the number of subnets you specify when you create a cluster or you can update the subnets after creating the cluster.

The network interfaces provisioned by Amazon EKS have a description of the format `Amazon EKS [.replaceable]``your-cluster-name```. See the example below for an {aws} CLI command you can use to find the IP addresses of the network interfaces that Amazon EKS provisions. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC you pass during cluster creation.

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]

--query 'NetworkInterfaces[?(VpcId == [.replaceable]`VPC_ID` && contains(Description,`Amazon EKS`))].PrivateIpAddress'

[#hybrid-nodes-networking-vpc]
== {aws} VPC and subnet setup

The existing <<network-reqs,VPC and subnet requirements>> for Amazon EKS apply to clusters with hybrid nodes. Additionally, your VPC CIDR can't overlap with your on-premises node and pod CIDRs. You must configure routes in your VPC routing table for your on-premises node and optionally pod CIDRs. These routes must be setup to route traffic to the gateway you are using for your hybrid network connectivity, which is commonly a virtual private gateway (VGW) or transit gateway (TGW). If you are using TGW or VGW to connect your VPC with your on-premises environment, you must create a TGW or VGW attachment for your VPC. Your VPC must have DNS hostname and DNS resolution support.

The following steps use the {aws} CLI. You can also create these resources in the {aws-management-console} or with other interfaces such as {aws} CloudFormation, {aws} CDK, or Terraform.

=== Step 1: Create VPC

. Run the following command to create a VPC. Replace `VPC_CIDR` with an `IPv4` RFC-1918 (private) or non-RFC-1918 (public) CIDR range (for example `10.0.0.0/16`).
Note: DNS resolution, which is an EKS requirement, is enabled for the VPC by default.
+
[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block [.replaceable]`VPC_CIDR`  
----
. Enable DNS hostnames for your VPC. Note, DNS resolution is enabled for the VPC by default. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC you created in the previous step.
+
[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id [.replaceable]`VPC_ID` --enable-dns-hostnames
----

=== Step 2: Create subnets

Create at least 2 subnets. Amazon EKS uses these subnets for the cluster network interfaces. For more information, see the <<network-requirements-subnets,Subnets requirements and considerations>>.

. You can find the availability zones for an {aws} Region with the following command. Replace `us-west-2` with your region.
+
[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones \
     --query 'AvailabilityZones[?(RegionName == `us-west-2`)].ZoneName'
----
. Create a subnet. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC. Replace `SUBNET_CIDR` with the CIDR block for your subnet (for example 10.0.1.0/24 ). Replace `AZ` with the availability zone where the subnet will be created (for example us-west-2a). The subnets you create must be in at least 2 different availability zones. 
+
[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --vpc-id [.replaceable]`VPC_ID` \
    --cidr-block [.replaceable]`SUBNET_CIDR` \
    --availability-zone [.replaceable]`AZ`
----

=== (Optional) Step 3: Attach VPC with Amazon VPC Transit Gateway (TGW) or {aws} Direct Connect virtual private gateway (VGW)

If you are using a TGW or VGW, attach your VPC to the TGW or VGW. For more information, see link:vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Amazon VPC attachments in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways,type="documentation"] or link:vpn/latest/s2svpn/how_it_works.html#VPNGateway[{aws} Direct Connect virtual private gateway associations,type="documentation"].


*Transit Gateway*

Run the following command to attach a Transit Gateway. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC. Replace `SUBNET_ID1` and `SUBNET_ID2` with the IDs of the subnets you created in the previous step. Replace `TGW_ID` with the ID of your TGW.

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment \
    --vpc-id [.replaceable]`VPC_ID` \
    --subnet-ids [.replaceable]`SUBNET_ID1 SUBNET_ID2` \
    --transit-gateway-id [.replaceable]`TGW_ID`
----


*Virtual Private Gateway*

Run the following command to attach a Transit Gateway. Replace `VPN_ID` with the ID of your VGW. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC.

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 attach-vpn-gateway \
    --vpn-gateway-id [.replaceable]`VPN_ID` \
    --vpc-id [.replaceable]`VPC_ID`
----


=== (Optional) Step 4: Create route table

You can modify the main route table for the VPC or you can create a custom route table. The following steps create a custom route table with the routes to on-premises node and pod CIDRs. For more information, see link:vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-route-tables.html[Subnet route tables,type="documentation"]. Replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC.

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id [.replaceable]`VPC_ID`
----


=== Step 5: Create routes for on-premises nodes and pods

Create routes in the route table for each of your on-premises remote nodes. You can modify the main route table for the VPC or use the custom route table you created in the previous step.

The examples below show how to create routes for your on-premises node and pod CIDRs. In the examples, a transit gateway (TGW) is used to connect the VPC with the on-premises environment. If you have multiple on-premises node and pods CIDRs, repeat the steps for each CIDR.

* If you are using an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway (VGW) replace `--transit-gateway-id` with `--gateway-id`.
* Replace `RT_ID` with the ID of the route table you created in the previous step.
* Replace `REMOTE_NODE_CIDR` with the CIDR range you will use for your hybrid nodes.
* Replace `REMOTE_POD_CIDR` with the CIDR range you will use for the pods running on hybrid nodes. The pod CIDR range corresponds to the Container Networking Interface (CNI) configuration, which most commonly uses an overlay network on-premises. For more information, see <<hybrid-nodes-cni>>.
* Replace `TGW_ID` with the ID of your TGW.

*Remote node network*

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id [.replaceable]`RT_ID` \
    --destination-cidr-block [.replaceable]`REMOTE_NODE_CIDR` \
    --transit-gateway-id [.replaceable]`TGW_ID`
----


*Remote Pod network*

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id [.replaceable]`RT_ID` \
    --destination-cidr-block [.replaceable]`REMOTE_POD_CIDR` \
    --transit-gateway-id [.replaceable]`TGW_ID`
----


=== (Optional) Step 6: Associate subnets with route table

If you created a custom route table in the previous step, associate each of the subnets you created in the previous step with your custom route table. If you are modifying the VPC main route table, the subnets are automatically associated with the main route table of the VPC and you can skip this step.

Run the following command for each of the subnets you created in the previous steps. Replace `RT_ID` with the route table you created in the previous step. Replace `SUBNET_ID` with the ID of a subnet.

[source,cli,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id [.replaceable]`RT_ID` --subnet-id [.replaceable]`SUBNET_ID`
----

To create a security group with the inbound access rules, run the following commands. This security group must be passed when you create your Amazon EKS cluster. By default, the command below creates a security group that allows all outbound access. You can restrict outbound access to include only the rules above. If you're considering limiting the outbound rules, we recommend that you thoroughly test all of your applications and pod connectivity before you apply your changed rules to a production cluster.

* In the first command, replace `SG_NAME` with a name for your security group
* In the first command, replace `VPC_ID` with the ID of the VPC you created in the previous step
* In the second command, replace `SG_ID` with the ID of the security group you create in the first command
* In the second command, replace `REMOTE_NODE_CIDR` and `REMOTE_POD_CIDR` with the values for your hybrid nodes and on-premises network.
