[#kubernetes-1-33]
== Kubernetes 1.33

Kubernetes `1.33` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.33`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The Dynamic Resource Allocation _beta_ Kubernetes API is enabled.
** This beta API improves the experience of scheduling and monitoring workloads that require resources such as GPUs. 
** The beta API is defined by the Kubernetes community, and might change in future versions of Kubernetes. 
** Carefully review https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages[Feature stages] in the Kubernetes documentation to understand the implications of using beta APIs. 
* {aws} is not releasing an EKS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Kubernetes 1.33. 
** {aws} encourages you to migrate to Amazon Linux 2023. Learn how to <<al2023>>.
** For more information, see <<al2-ami-deprecation>>.
====

* *In-Place Pod Resource Resize (Beta):* In-place resource resize has been promoted to beta, allowing dynamic updates to CPU and memory resources for existing Pods without restarts - enabling vertical scaling of stateful workloads with zero downtime and seamless resource adjustments based on traffic patterns.
* *Sidecar Containers Now Stable:* Sidecar containers have graduated to stable, implementing sidecars as special init containers with `restartPolicy: Always` that start before application containers, run throughout the pod lifecycle, and support probes for operational state signaling.
** For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/[Sidecar Containers] in the _Kubernetes Documentation_. 
* *Endpoints API Deprecation:* The Endpoints API is now officially deprecated and will return warnings when accessed - migrate workloads and scripts to use the EndpointSlices API instead, which supports modern features like dual-stack networking and handles multiple EndpointSlices per Service.
** For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/24/endpoints-deprecation/[Kubernetes v1.33: Continuing the transition from Endpoints to EndpointSlice] on the _Kubernetes Blog_. 
* *Elastic Fabric Adapter Support:* The default security group for Amazon EKS clusters now supports Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) traffic. The default security group has a new outbound rule that allows EFA traffic with the destination of the same security group. This allows EFA traffic within the cluster. 
** For more information, see link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html["Elastic Fabric Adapter for AI/ML and HPC workloads on Amazon EC2",type="documentation"] in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

[#kubernetes-1-32]
== Kubernetes 1.32

Kubernetes `1.32` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.32`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/11/kubernetes-v1-32-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3` API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed in version `1.32`. If you are using these APIs, you must update your configurations to use the latest supported version before upgrading.

* ServiceAccount `metadata.annotations[kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets]` has been deprecated in version `1.32` and will be removed in a future Kubernetes minor version release. It is recommended to use separate namespaces to isolate access to mounted secrets.

* Kubernetes version `1.32` is the last version for which Amazon EKS will release Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) AMIs. From version `1.33` onwards, Amazon EKS will continue to release Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) and Bottlerocket based AMIs. 

====

* The Memory Manager feature has graduated to Generally Available (GA) status in Kubernetes version `1.32`. This enhancement provides more efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications, particularly beneficial for workloads with specific memory requirements.

* PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) created by StatefulSets now include automatic cleanup functionality. When PVCs are no longer needed, they will be automatically deleted while maintaining data persistence during StatefulSet updates and node maintenance operations. This feature simplifies storage management and helps prevent orphaned PVCs in your cluster.

* Custom Resource Field Selector functionality has been introduced, allowing developers to add field selectors to custom resources. This feature provides the same filtering capabilities available for built-in Kubernetes objects to custom resources, enabling more precise and efficient resource filtering and promoting better API design practices.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.32` changelog, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md

=== Anonymous authentication changes

Starting with Amazon EKS `1.32`, anonymous authentication is restricted to the following API server health check endpoints:

* `/healthz`
* `/livez`
* `/readyz`

Requests to any other endpoint using the `system:unauthenticated` user will receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response. This security enhancement helps prevent unintended cluster access that could occur due to misconfigured RBAC policies.

[NOTE]
====
The `public-info-viewer` RBAC role continues to apply for the health check endpoints listed above.
====

[#al2-ami-deprecation]
=== Amazon Linux 2 AMI deprecation

For Kubernetes versions 1.33 and later, EKS will not provide pre-built optimized Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

{aws} suggests adopting EKS Auto Mode, or migrating to a more recent operating system, such as Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) or Bottlerocket. 

- <<auto-migrate-mng>>
- <<al2023>>
- <<eks-optimized-ami-bottlerocket>>

NOTE: This update applies to EKS-optimized AL2 AMIs. For more information about the operating system itself, see link:amazon-linux-2/faqs/[Amazon Linux 2 FAQs,type="marketing"].


[#kubernetes-1-31]
== Kubernetes 1.31

Kubernetes `1.31` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.31`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====


* The kubelet flag `--keep-terminated-pod-volumes` deprecated since 2017 has been removed as part of the version `1.31` release. This change impacts how terminated pod volumes are handled by the kubelet. If you are using this flag in your node configurations, you must update your bootstrap scripts and launch templates to remove it before upgrading.

====

* The beta `VolumeAttributesClass` feature gate and API resource is enabled in Amazon EKS version `1.31`. This feature allows cluster operators to modify mutable properties of Persistent Volumes (PVs) managed by compatible CSI Drivers, including the Amazon EBS CSI Driver. To leverage this feature, ensure that your CSI Driver supports the `VolumeAttributesClass` feature (for the Amazon EBS CSI Driver, upgrade to version `1.35.0` or later to automatically enable the feature). You will be able to create `VolumeAttributesClass` objects to define the desired volume attributes, such as volume type and throughput, and associate them with your Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/[official Kubernetes documentation] as well as the documentation of your CSI driver for more information.
** For more information about the Amazon EBS CSI Driver, see <<ebs-csi>>.
* Kubernetes support for https://apparmor.net/[AppArmor] has graduated to stable and is now generally available for public use. This feature allows you to protect your containers with AppArmor by setting the `appArmorProfile.type` field in the container's `securityContext`. Prior to Kubernetes version `1.30`, AppArmor was controlled by annotations. Starting with version `1.30`, it is controlled using fields. To leverage this feature, we recommend migrating away from annotations and using the `appArmorProfile.type` field to ensure that your workloads are compatible.
* The PersistentVolume last phase transition time feature has graduated to stable and is now generally available for public use in Kubernetes version `1.31`. This feature introduces a new field, `.status.lastTransitionTime`, in the PersistentVolumeStatus, which provides a timestamp of when a PersistentVolume last transitioned to a different phase. This enhancement allows for better tracking and management of PersistentVolumes, particularly in scenarios where understanding the lifecycle of volumes is important.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.31` changelog, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md 

[#kubernetes-1-30]
== Kubernetes 1.30

Kubernetes `1.30` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.30`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/04/17/kubernetes-v1-30-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====


* Starting with Amazon EKS version `1.30` or newer, any newly created managed node groups will automatically default to using Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) as the node operating system. Previously, new node groups would default to Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). You can continue to use AL2 by choosing it as the AMI type when creating a new node group. 
** For information about migrating from AL2 to AL2023, see <<al2023>>.
** For more information about Amazon Linux, see link:linux/al2023/ug/compare-with-al2.html[Comparing AL2 and AL2023,type="documentation"] in the Amazon Linux User Guide. 
** For more information about specifiying the operating system for a managed node group, see <<create-managed-node-group>>.

====

* With Amazon EKS `1.30`, the `topology.k8s.aws/zone-id` label is added to worker nodes. You can use Availability Zone IDs (AZ IDs) to determine the location of resources in one account relative to the resources in another account. For more information, see link:ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html[Availability Zone IDs for your {aws} resources,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} RAM User Guide_. 
* Starting with `1.30`, Amazon EKS no longer includes the `default` annotation on the `gp2 StorageClass` resource applied to newly created clusters. This has no impact if you are referencing this storage class by name. You must take action if you were relying on having a default `StorageClass` in the cluster. You should reference the `StorageClass` by the name `gp2`. Alternatively, you can deploy the Amazon EBS recommended default storage class by setting the `defaultStorageClass.enabled` parameter to true when installing version `1.31.0` or later of the `aws-ebs-csi-driver add-on`. 
* The minimum required IAM policy for the Amazon EKS cluster IAM role has changed. The action `ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones` is required. For more information, see <<cluster-iam-role>>.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.30` changelog, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md.
