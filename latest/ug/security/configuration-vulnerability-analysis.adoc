= Analyze vulnerabilities in Amazon EKS
:info_titleabbrev: Analyze vulnerabilities

[abstract]
--
Learn how to analyze the security configuration and vulnerabilities of your Amazon EKS clusters and resources using tools like the CIS EKS Benchmark, platform versions, vulnerability lists, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon GuardDuty for comprehensive threat detection and protection.
--

Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining Kubernetes clusters and applications. The following lists resources for you to analyze the security configuration of your EKS clusters, resources for you to check for vulnerabilities, and integrations with {aws} services that can do that analysis for you.

== The Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for Amazon EKS

The https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/[Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark] provides guidance for Amazon EKS security configurations. The benchmark:

* Is applicable to Amazon EC2 nodes (both managed and self-managed) where you are responsible for security configurations of Kubernetes components.  
* Provides a standard, community-approved way to ensure that you have configured your Kubernetes cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS.
* Consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services.
* Supports all of the Kubernetes versions currently available in Amazon EKS and can be run using https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench[kube-bench], a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on Kubernetes clusters.

To learn more, see link:containers/introducing-cis-amazon-eks-benchmark[Introducing The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark,type="blog"].

For an automated `aws-sample` pipeline to update your node group with a CIS benchmarked AMI, see https://github.com/aws-samples/pipeline-for-hardening-eks-nodes-and-automating-updates[EKS-Optimized AMI Hardening Pipeline].

== Amazon EKS platform versions

Amazon EKS _platform versions_ represent the capabilities of the cluster control plane, including which Kubernetes API server flags are enabled and the current Kubernetes patch version. New clusters are deployed with the latest platform version. For details, see link:eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.html[EKS platform-versions,type="documentation"].

You can <<update-cluster,update an Amazon EKS cluster>> to newer Kubernetes versions. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version. For more information about Kubernetes versions in EKS, see link:eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html[Amazon EKS supported versions,type="documentation"].

Security and privacy events include an overview of the issue affected, packages, and instructions for updating your instances to correct the issue.

[#configuration-vulnerability-analysis-inspector]
== Node detection with Amazon Inspector

You can use link:inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_introduction.html[Amazon Inspector,type="documentation"] to check for unintended network accessibility of your nodes and for vulnerabilities on those Amazon EC2 instances.

[#configuration-vulnerability-analysis-guardduty]
== Cluster and node detection with Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty threat detection service that helps protect your accounts, containers, workloads, and the data within your {aws} environment. Among other features, GuardDuty offers the following two features that detect potential threats to your EKS clusters: _EKS Protection_ and _Runtime Monitoring_.

For more information, see <<integration-guardduty>>.
