The following Amazon EKS add-ons are available to create on your cluster. You can view the most current list of available add-ons using `eksctl`, the {aws-management-console}, or the {aws} CLI. To see all available add-ons or to install an add-on, see <<creating-an-add-on>>. If an add-on requires IAM permissions, then you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for your cluster. To determine whether you have one, or to create one, see <<enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts>>. You can an create or delete an add-on after you've installed it. For more information, see <<updating-an-add-on>> or <<removing-an-add-on>>. For more information about considerations specific to running EKS add-ons with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes, see <<hybrid-nodes-add-ons>>.

You can use any of the following Amazon EKS add-ons.
