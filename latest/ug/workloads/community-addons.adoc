[#community-addons]
= Community add-ons 

You can use {aws} APIs to install community add-ons, such as the Kubernetes Metrics Server. You may choose to install community add-ons as Amazon EKS Add-ons to reduce the complexity of maintaining the software on multiple clusters. 

For example, you can use the {aws} API, CLI, or Management Console to install community add-ons. You can install a community add-on during cluster creation. 

You manage community add-ons just like existing Amazon EKS Add-ons. Community add-ons are different from existing add-ons in that they have a unique scope of support. 

NOTE: Using community add-ons is at your discretion. As part of the xref:security[shared responsibility model] between you and {aws}, you are expected to understand what you are installing into your cluster for these third party plugins. You are also responsible for the community add-ons meeting your cluster security needs. For more information, see <<oss-scope>>. 

Community add-ons are not built by {aws}. {aws} only validates community add-ons for version compatibility. For example, if you install a community add-on on a cluster, {aws} checks if it is compatible with the Kubernetes version of your cluster. 

Importantly, {aws} does not provide full support for community add-ons. {aws} supports only lifecycle operations done using {aws} APIs, such as installing add-ons or deleting add-ons. 

If you require support for a community add-on, utilize the existing project resources. For example, you may create a GitHub issue on the repo for the project.

== Determine add-on type

You can use the {aws} CLI to determine the type of an Amazon EKS Add-on. 

Use the following CLI command to retrieve information about an add-on. You can replace `metrics-server` with the name of any add-on. 

```bash
aws eks describe-addon-versions --addon-name metrics-server
```

Review the CLI output for the `owner` field.

```
{
    "addons": [
        {
            "addonName": "metrics-server",
            "type": "observability",
            "owner": "community", 
            "addonVersions": [
```

If the value of `owner` is `community`, then the add-on is a community add-on. {aws} only provides support for installing, updating, and removing the add-on. If you have questions about the functionality and operation of the add-on itself, use community resources like GitHub issues. 


== Install or update community add-on

You install or update community add-ons in the same way as other Amazon EKS Add-ons.

* <<updating-an-add-on>>
* <<removing-an-add-on>>

[#kubernetes-metrics-server]
=== Kubernetes Metrics Server

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is a scalable and efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines. It collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler.

[#kube-state-metrics]
=== kube-state-metrics

Add-on agent to generate and expose cluster-level metrics.

The state of Kubernetes objects in the Kubernetes API can be exposed as metrics. An add-on agent called kube-state-metrics can connect to the Kubernetes API server and expose a HTTP endpoint with metrics generated from the state of individual objects in the cluster. It exposes various information about the state of objects like labels and annotations, startup and termination times, status or the phase the object currently is in.

[#external-dns]
=== External DNS

The External DNS EKS add-on can be used to manage Route53 DNS records through Kubernetes resources.

External DNS permissions can be reduced to `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets`, `route53:ListHostedZones`, and `route53:ListResourceRecordSets` on the hosted zones you wish to manage.

[#fluent-bit]
=== Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit is a lightweight and high-performance log processor and forwarder. It allows you to collect data/logs from different sources, unify them, and send them to multiple destinations including Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Fluent Bit is designed with performance and resource efficiency in mind, making it ideal for Kubernetes environments.

This add-on does not require IAM permissions in the default configuration. However, you may need to grant this add-on IAM permissions if you configure an {aws} output location. For more information, see <<update-addon-role>>.
