Learn how to manage access entries for IAM principals to your Amazon EKS cluster, including creating, updating, and deleting access entries for fine-grained authentication and authorization.

*What is EKS access entries?*

EKS access entries is the best way to grant users access to the Kubernetes API. For example, you can use access entries to grant developers access to use kubectl.

Fundamentally, an EKS access entry associates a set of Kubernetes permissions with an IAM identity, such as an IAM role. For example, a developer may assume an IAM role and use that to authenticate to an EKS Cluster.

You can attach Kubernetes permissions to access entries in two ways:

* Use an access policy. Access policies are pre-defined Kubernetes permissions templates maintained by {aws}. For more information, see <<access-policy-permissions>>.
* Reference a Kubernetes group. If you associate an IAM Identity with a Kubernetes group, you can create Kubernetes resources that grant the group permissions. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Using RBAC Authorization] in the Kubernetes documentation.

*Advantages*

Amazon EKS cluster access management enables you to control authentication and authorization for your Kubernetes clusters directly through Amazon EKS APIs. This feature simplifies access management by eliminating the need to switch between {aws} and Kubernetes APIs when managing user permissions. Using access entries and access policies, you can define granular permissions for {aws} IAM principals, including the ability to modify or revoke cluster-admin permissions from the cluster creator.

The feature integrates with infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like {aws} CloudFormation, Terraform, and {aws} CDK, allowing you to define access configurations during cluster creation. If misconfigurations occur, you can restore cluster access through the Amazon EKS API without requiring direct Kubernetes API access. This centralized approach reduces operational overhead and improves security by leveraging existing {aws} IAM capabilities such as CloudTrail audit logging and multi-factor authentication.

== Get Started

. Determine the IAM Identity and Access policy you want to use.
** <<access-policy-permissions>>
. Enable EKS Access Entries on your cluster. Confirm you have a supported platform version.
** <<setting-up-access-entries>>
. Create an access entry that associates an IAM Identity with Kubernetes permission.
** <<creating-access-entries>>
. Authenticate to the cluster using the IAM identity.
** <<install-awscli>>
** <<install-kubectl>>

== Legacy cluster access configuration

When you enable EKS access entries on clusters created before this feature was introduced (clusters with initial platform versions earlier than those specified in Platform Version Requirements), EKS automatically creates an access entry that reflects pre-existing permissions. 

This access entry shows the IAM identity that originally created the cluster, and the administrative permissions granted to that identity during cluster creation. Previously, this administrative access was granted automatically and couldn't be modified. With EKS access entries enabled, you can now view and delete this legacy access configuration.

If your cluster uses the link:eks/latest/userguide/migrating-access-entries.html[legacy `aws-auth` ConfigMap,type="documentation"] for access management, note that only the access entry for the original cluster creator is automatically created when enabling access entries. Any additional roles or permissions created in the ConfigMap beyond the original creator (e.g., custom IAM roles for developers or services) are not automatically added to access entries.
