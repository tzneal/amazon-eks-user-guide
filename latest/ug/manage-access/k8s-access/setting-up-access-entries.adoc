[#setting-up-access-entries]
= Change authentication mode to use access entries
:info_titleabbrev: Authentication mode

To begin using access entries, you must change the authentication mode of the cluster to either the `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP` or `API` modes. This adds the API for access entries.

[#access-entries-setup-console]
== {aws} Console

. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. Choose the name of the cluster that you want to create an access entry in.
. Choose the *Access* tab.
. The *Authentication mode* shows the current authentication mode of the cluster. If the mode says EKS API, you can already add access entries and you can skip the remaining steps.
. Choose *Manage access*.
. For *Cluster authentication mode*, select a mode with the EKS API. Note that you can't change the authentication mode back to a mode that removes the EKS API and access entries.
. Choose *Save changes*. Amazon EKS begins to update the cluster, the status of the cluster changes to Updating, and the change is recorded in the *Update history* tab.
. Wait for the status of the cluster to return to Active. When the cluster is Active, you can follow the steps in <<creating-access-entries>> to add access to the cluster for IAM principals.

[#access-setup-cli]
== {aws} CLI

. Install the {aws} CLI, as described in link:cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[Installing, updating, and uninstalling the {aws} CLI,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} Command Line Interface User Guide_.
. Run the following command. Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster. If you want to disable the `ConfigMap` method permanently, replace `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP` with `API`.
+
Amazon EKS begins to update the cluster, the status of the cluster changes to UPDATING, and the change is recorded in the  [command]*aws eks list-updates*.

[source,bash]
----
aws eks update-cluster-config --name my-cluster --access-config authenticationMode=API_AND_CONFIG_MAP
----
. Wait for the status of the cluster to return to Active. When the cluster is Active, you can follow the steps in <<creating-access-entries>> to add access to the cluster for IAM principals.


== Required platform version

To use _access entries_, the cluster must have a platform version that is the same or later than the version listed in the following table, or a Kubernetes version that is later than the versions listed in the table. If your Kubernetes version is not listed, all platform versions support access entries. 

[%header,cols="2"]
|===
| Kubernetes version | Platform version
| Not Listed | All Supported
| `1.30` | `eks.2`
| `1.29` | `eks.1`
| `1.28` | `eks.6`
|===
