Learn how to configure account role access for Amazon EKS workloads using Pod Identity.
--

When running applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), you might need to access {aws} resources that exist in different {aws} accounts. This guide shows you how to set up cross account access using EKS Pod Identity, which enables your Kubernetes pods to access other {aws} resources using target roles.

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-agent-setup.html[Set up the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html[Create an EKS Pod Identity role]

== How It Works

Pod Identity enables applications in your EKS cluster to access {aws} resources across accounts through a process called role chaining. 

When creating a Pod Identity association, you can provide two IAM roles: an link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] in the same account as your EKS cluster and a Target IAM Role from the account containing your {aws} resources you wish to access, (like S3 buckets or RDS Databases). The link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] must be in your EKS cluster's account due to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_iam-passrole-service.html[IAM PassRole] requirements, while the Target IAM Role can be in any {aws} account. PassRole enables an {aws} entity to delegate role assumption to another service. EKS Pod Identity uses PassRole to connect a role to a Kubernetes service account, requiring both the role and the identity passing it to be in the same {aws} account as the EKS cluster. When your application pod needs to access {aws} resources, it requests credentials from Pod Identity. Pod Identity then automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"], then using those credentials to assume the Target IAM Role. This process provides your pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in other {aws} accounts.

== Caching considerations

Due to caching mechanisms, updates to an IAM role in an existing Pod Identity association may not take effect immediately in the pods running on your EKS cluster. The Pod Identity Agent caches IAM credentials based on the association's configuration at the time the credentials are fetched. If the association includes only an link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] and no Target IAM Role, the cached credentials last for 6 hours. If the association includes both the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] ARN and a Target IAM Role, the cached credentials last for 59 minutes. Modifying an existing association, such as updating the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] ARN or adding a Target IAM Role, does not reset the existing cache. As a result, the agent will not recognize updates until the cached credentials refresh. To apply changes sooner, you can recreate the existing pods; otherwise, you will need to wait for the cache to expire.

== Step 1: Create and associate a Target IAM Role

In this step, you will establish a secure trust chain by creating and configuring a Target IAM Role. For demonstration, we will create a new Target IAM Role to establish a trust chain between two {aws} accounts: the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] (e.g., `eks-pod-identity-primary-role`) in the EKS cluster's {aws} account gains permission to assume the Target IAM Role (e.g. `eks-pod-identity-aws-resources`) in your target account, enabling access to {aws} resources like Amazon S3 buckets.

=== Create the Target IAM Role

1. Open the link:iam/home#/clusters[Amazon IAM console,type="console"].
2. In the top navigation bar, verify that you are signed into the account containing the {aws} resources (like S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables) for your Target IAM Role.
3. In the left navigation pane, choose *Roles*.
4. Choose the *Create role* button, then *{aws} account* under "Trusted entity type."
5. Choose *Another {aws} account*, enter your {aws} account number (the account where your link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] exists), then choose *Next*.
6. Add the permission policies you would like to associate to the role (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess), then choose *Next*.
7. Enter a role name, such as `MyCustomIAMTargetRole`, then choose *Create role*.

=== Update the Target IAM Role trust policy

1. After creating the role, you'll be returned to the *Roles* list. Find and select the new role you created in the previous step (e.g., `MyCustomIAMTargetRole`).
2. Select the *Trust relationships* tab.
3. Click *Edit trust policy* on the right side.
4. In the policy editor, replace the default JSON with your trust policy. Replace the placeholder values for role name and `111122223333` in the IAM role ARN with the {aws} account ID hosting your EKS cluster. You can also optionally use PrincipalTags in the role trust policy to authorize only specific service accounts from a given cluster and namespace to assume your target role . For example:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "sts:AssumeRole",
        "sts:TagSession"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalTag/eks-cluster-arn": "arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:111122223333:cluster/example-cluster",
          "aws:PrincipalTag/kubernetes-namespace": "ExampleNameSpace",
          "aws:PrincipalTag/kubernetes-service-account": "ExampleServiceAccountName"
        },
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalARN": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:role/eks-pod-identity-primary-role"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
The above policy policy lets the role `eks-pod-identeity-primary-role` from {aws} account 111122223333 with the relevant link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-abac.html["EKS Pod Identity Session Tags",type="documentation"] assume this role.

If you link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-abac.html#pod-id-abac-tags["Disabled Session Tags",type="documentation"] in your EKS Pod Identity, EKS Pod Identity also sets the `sts:ExternalId` with information about the cluster, namespace, and service account of a pod when assuming a target role.
[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "region/111122223333/cluster-name/namespace/service-account-name"
        },
        "ArnEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalARN": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:role/eks-pod-identity-primary-role"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:TagSession"
    }
  ]
}
----
The above policy helps ensure that only the expected cluster, namespace and service account can assume the target role. 

=== Update the permission policy for EKS Pod Identity role

In this step, you will update the permission policy of the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] associated with your Amazon EKS cluster by adding the Target IAM Role ARN as a resource.

1. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console].
2. In the left navigation pane, select *Clusters*, and then select the name of your EKS cluster.
3. Choose the *Access* tab.
4. Under *Pod Identity associations*, select your link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"].
5. Choose *Permissions*, *Add permissions*, then *Create inline policy*.
6. Choose *JSON* on the right side.
7. In the policy editor, replace the default JSON with your permission policy. Replace the placeholder value for role name and `222233334444` in the IAM role ARN with your Target IAM Role. For example:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "sts:TagSession"
            ],
            "Resource": "{arn-aws}iam::222233334444:role/eks-pod-identity-aws-resources"
        }
    ]
}
----

== Step 2: Associate the Target IAM Role to a Kubernetes service account

In this step, you will create an association between the Target IAM role and the Kubernetes service account in your EKS cluster.

1. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console].
2. In the left navigation pane, select *Clusters*, and then select the name of the cluster that you want to add the association to.
3. Choose the *Access* tab.
4. In the *Pod Identity associations*, choose *Create*.
5. Choose the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"] in *IAM role* for your workloads to assume.
6. Choose the Target IAM role in *Target IAM role* that will be assumed by the link:eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-role.html["EKS Pod Identity role",type="documentation"].
7. In the *Kubernetes namespace* field, enter the name of the namespace where you want to create the association (e.g., `my-app-namespace`). This defines where the service account resides.
8. In the *Kubernetes service account* field, enter the name of the service account (e.g., `my-service-account`) that will use the IAM credentials. This links the IAM role to the service account.
9. Choose *Create* to create the association.
