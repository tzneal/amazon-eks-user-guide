= Configure EKS Dashboard integration with {aws} Organizations
:info_titleabbrev: Configure organizations

This section provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the EKS Dashboard's integration with {aws} Organizations. You'll learn how to enable and disable trusted access between services, as well as how to register and deregister delegated administrator accounts. Each configuration task can be performed using either the {aws} console or the {aws} CLI.

== Enable trusted access

Trusted access authorizes the EKS Dashboard to securely access cluster information across all accounts in your organization.

=== Using the {aws} console

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Navigate to the EKS console in the us-east-1 region.
. In the left sidebar, select Dashboard Settings.
. Click *Enable trusted access*.

[NOTE]
====
When you enable trusted access through the EKS console, the system automatically creates the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKSDashboard` service-linked role. This automatic creation does not occur if you enable trusted access using the {aws} CLI or {aws} Organizations console.
====

[#dashboard-enable-cli]
=== Using the {aws} CLI

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Run the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name dashboard.eks.amazonaws.com
aws organizations enable-aws-service-access --service-principal eks.amazonaws.com
----

== Disable trusted access

Disabling trusted access revokes the EKS Dashboard's permission to access cluster information across your organization's accounts.

=== Using the {aws} console

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Navigate to the EKS Console in the us-east-1 region.
. In the left sidebar, select Dashboard Settings.
. Click *Disable trusted access*.

=== Using the {aws} CLI

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws organizations disable-aws-service-access --service-principal eks.amazonaws.com
----

== Enable a delegated administrator account

A delegated administrator is a member account that's granted permission to access the EKS Dashboard.

=== Using the {aws} console

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Navigate to the EKS console in the us-east-1 region.
. In the left sidebar, select Dashboard Settings.
. Click *Register delegated administrator*.
. Enter the Account ID of the {aws} Account you want to choose as delegated administrator.
. Confirm the registration.

=== Using the {aws} CLI

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Run the following command, replacing `123456789012` with your account ID:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws organizations register-delegated-administrator --account-id 123456789012 --service-principal eks.amazonaws.com
----

== Disable a delegated administrator account

Disabling a delegated administrator removes the account's permission to access the EKS Dashboard.

=== Using the {aws} console

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Navigate to the EKS console in the us-east-1 region.
. In the left sidebar, select Dashboard Settings.
. Locate the delegated administrator in the list.
. Click *Deregister* next to the account you want to remove as delegated administrator.

=== Using the {aws} CLI

. Log in to the management account of your {aws} Organization.
. Run the following command, replacing `123456789012` with the account ID of the delegated administrator:
+
[source,bash]
----
aws organizations deregister-delegated-administrator --account-id 123456789012 --service-principal eks.amazonaws.com
----

[#dashboard-iam-policy]
