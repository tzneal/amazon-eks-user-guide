= View and manage Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas
:info_titleabbrev: Service quotas

[abstract]
--
Use Service Quotas to view and manage Amazon EKS and {aws} Fargate quotas from the {aws-management-console} or {aws} CLI.
--

Amazon EKS has integrated with Service Quotas, an {aws} service that you can use to view and manage your quotas from a central location. For more information, see link:servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[What Is Service Quotas?,type="documentation"] in the _Service Quotas User Guide_. With Service Quotas integration, you can quickly look up the value of your Amazon EKS and {aws} Fargate service quotas using the {aws-management-console} and {aws} CLI.


[#service-quotas-console]
== View EKS service quotas in the {aws-management-console}

. Open the link:servicequotas/home/services/eks/quotas["Service Quotas console",type="console"].
. In the left navigation pane, choose *{aws} services*.
. From the *{aws} services* list, search for and select *Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)* or *{aws} Fargate*.
+
In the *Service quotas* list, you can see the service quota name, applied value (if it's available), {aws} default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable.
. To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description, choose the quota name.
. (Optional) To request a quota increase, select the quota that you want to increase, select *Request quota increase*, enter or select the required information, and select *Request*.


To work more with service quotas using the {aws-management-console}, see the link:servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[Service Quotas User Guide,type="documentation"]. To request a quota increase, see link:servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a Quota Increase,type="documentation"] in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.


== View EKS service quotas with the {aws} CLI

Run the following command to view your Amazon EKS quotas.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code eks \
    --output table
----

Run the following command to view your Fargate quotas.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code fargate \
    --output table
----

NOTE: The quota returned is the number of Amazon ECS tasks or Amazon EKS Pods that can run concurrently on Fargate in this account in the current {aws} Region.

To work more with service quotas using the {aws} CLI, see link:cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/index.html[service-quotas,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} CLI Command Reference_. To request a quota increase, see the link:cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html[request-service-quota-increase,type="documentation"] command in the _{aws} CLI Command Reference_.


[#sq-text]
== Amazon EKS service quotas

{aws} recommends using the {aws-management-console} to view your current quotas. For more information, see <<service-quotas-console>>.

To view the default EKS service quotas, see link:general/latest/gr/eks.html#limits_eks["Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service endpoints and quotas",type="documentation"] in the _{aws} General Reference_.

These service quotas are listed under *Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)* in the Service Quotas console. To request a quota increase for values that are shown as adjustable, see link:servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase,type="documentation"] in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

[NOTE]
====
Adjustments to the following components are **not** supported in Service Quotas:
* Pod Identity associations per cluster. For limits, see <<pod-identities>>.
* CIDRs for Remote Node Networks or Remote Pod Networks for hybrid nodes. For limits, see <<hybrid-nodes-overview>>.
====

[#service-quotas-eks-fargate]
== {aws} Fargate service quotas

The *{aws} Fargate* service in the Service Quotas console lists several service quotas. You can configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information, see <<service-quota-alarm>>.

New {aws} accounts might have lower initial quotas that can increase over time. Fargate constantly monitors the account usage within each {aws} Region, and then automatically increases the quotas based on the usage. You can also request a quota increase for values that are shown as adjustable. For more information, see link:servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase,type="documentation"] in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

{aws} recomends using the {aws-management-console} to view your current quotas. For more information, see <<service-quotas-console>>.

To view default {aws} Fargate on EKS service quotas, see link:general/latest/gr/eks.html#service-quotas-eks-fargate["Fargate service quotas",type="documentation"] in the _{aws} General Reference_.

[NOTE]
====

Fargate additionally enforces Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS Pods launch rate quotas. For more information, see link:AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/throttling.html[{aws} Fargate throttling quotas,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon ECS guide_.
