Amazon EKS supports Kubecost, which you can use to monitor your costs broken down by Kubernetes resources including Pods, nodes, namespaces, and labels. This topic covers installing Kubecost, and accessing the Kubecost dashboard.

Amazon EKS provides an {aws} optimized bundle of Kubecost for cluster cost visibility. You can use your existing {aws} support agreements to obtain support. For more information about the available versions of Kubecost, see <<cost-monitoring-kubecost-bundles>>.

== Install Amazon EKS optimized Kubecost bundle

You can use one of the following procedures to install the _Amazon EKS optimized Kubecost bundle_:

* Before start, it is recommended to review https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/kubecost/self-hosted/2.x?topic=installations-amazon-eks-integration[Kubecost - Architecture Overview] to understand how Kubecost works on Amazon EKS.
* If you are new to Amazon EKS, we recommend that you use the Amazon EKS add-on for the installation because it simplifies the _Amazon EKS optimized Kubecost bundle_ installation.
